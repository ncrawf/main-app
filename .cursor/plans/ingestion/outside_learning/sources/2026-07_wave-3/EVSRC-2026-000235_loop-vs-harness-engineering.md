> **HOW TO USE THIS FILE — two kinds of marks:**
> • `TK` = a field the normalizer (Opus) fills from the screenshot — **leave it alone.**
> • **⬇️ PASTE blocks = the ONLY spots Nick touches.** Exactly **3**: transcript (§1), **Knox read (§3 Review 001)**, gut note (§3 Review 002, optional). Plus: **drop the screenshot in chat** → Opus fills §0.
> Copy this into `sources/<YYYY-MM>/`, rename `EVSRC-2026-000235_TK.md` (id = highest EVSRC + 1), add a row to `../../00_index.md`.
>
> **Per-source flow (the standard):** Nick pastes transcript (§1) + Knox's strategic read (§3 **Review 001** — paste it AS-IS, however rich Knox makes it; do NOT reformat into fields) + optional gut note (§3 Review 002). Then the agent (Opus) writes **§3 Review 003 — formal deep extraction** (formalizing Review 001, NOT rediscovering it), updates the run's **concept registry** (cross-source synthesis), the coverage matrix, and fills **§4 pointers** at closeout. **The per-source deep read lives HERE in §3 — never in a separate sidecar/extraction file** (`GRD-044`). Cross-source synthesis lives in the EVRUN concept registry.

The Loop Engineering Buzzword
0:00
Apparently, we're not even supposed to
0:01
be prompting our AI coding assistants
0:03
anymore. The real skill is designing
0:06
loops that prompt your agents so they
0:07
work for you 24/7. And I got to say, I
0:10
am not sold on this idea right now. It
0:13
feels like some of the bigger players in
0:15
the AI space like Peter Steinberger, the
0:17
creator of OpenClaw, Boris Churnney is
0:19
doing this as well, the lead at Claude
0:21
Code, they're pushing this new fad,
0:23
whether they like it or not, of loop
0:25
engineering. It's becoming the next
0:27
buzzword. And I promise I'm not going to
0:29
be hyping up loop engineering here.
0:31
There are some good lessons to be
0:33
learned from what's surfacing, but also
0:36
with loops, and you've probably seen
0:37
this with dynamic workflows and cloud
0:39
code for example, they're not always the
0:40
most reliable and they are extremely
0:43
tokenhungry. So unless you have an
0:45
infinite budget like Peter pretty much,
0:47
then you have to be really careful with
0:49
these kinds of systems. They're not
0:51
always practical. And so that's what I
0:54
want to cover with you in this video. I
0:56
just want to get really honest and
0:57
really practical with you. We're going
0:58
to cover three things. We're going to
1:00
cover loops in a really simple sense.
1:02
It's not actually that complicated. So,
1:04
I want to show you how you can run these
1:05
and then I want to talk about the
1:06
trade-offs and then solutions to that.
1:08
So, really nice and structured here. And
1:10
so, as far as some of the solutions
1:12
we'll get into towards the end of the
1:13
video, I want to show you how we can
1:15
build a system where we can really
1:16
observe the loops, the orchestrators and
1:19
the workers, how we can optimize for
1:21
cost with the workflows we build and
1:23
using different providers like PI. And
1:25
so it really it's like here's how you
1:26
can run loops. Here are the downsides.
1:29
Here's how we can solve for them and
1:30
really get to the point where we're
1:32
building harnesses for these longer
1:34
running tasks because it is really
1:36
powerful for certain things, but then
1:38
also covering the honest trade-offs with
1:40
it. Okay, so we saw what Peter said. Now
The Core Concept of Loops
1:42
let's take a look at what Boris, the
1:43
creator of Claude Code, said, and it is
1:46
really similar. He said, "I don't prompt
1:48
Claude anymore. I write loops and the
1:50
loops do the work. My job is to write
1:52
loops." Okay, Boris, I think we get it.
1:55
And like I said, loop engineering is
1:57
kind of a buzzword, but also there are
1:59
some really good takeaways when you dive
2:01
into this. So, like Boris through a lot
2:02
of like interviews and podcasts has
2:04
shared his workflow. We can get glimpses
2:06
into how it works. [clears throat] A lot
2:08
of it is built around the newer features
2:10
in claude code. Like /loop is the most
2:13
basic example, and I told you we're
2:14
going to simplify things here. Loop
2:16
engineering is really not that
2:17
complicated. I don't even know if it
2:18
deserves its own term. And so with
2:21
/loop, we set an interval for running a
2:23
prompt. So like for example, every 5
2:25
minutes, I'm going to check for new
2:27
GitHub issues in this repo and handle
2:30
any that come in. So it's pretty neat.
2:32
We set up Claude to basically wake
2:34
itself up every 5 minutes. And of
2:36
course, you can adjust this. And it's
2:38
going to look for input in an external
2:40
system like GitHub, for example. And so
2:42
as long as our terminal is up and
2:45
running with cloud code, it's able to
2:47
autonomously handle this. So basically
2:48
it's a every 5 minute loop looking at
2:51
GitHub issues. There's also /goal that
2:53
we have in cloud code and codeex. So we
2:56
set some criteria like here is how you
2:58
know you are done and then we're forcing
3:00
the coding agent to work until it is
3:02
done. Kind of like Ralph loops that went
3:04
viral a few months ago. And then last we
3:07
have / routines. And so these are the
3:09
schedule jobs. Like every hour I want
3:11
you to wake up look at some larger spec
3:13
document and then handle the next task.
3:16
And so really loop engineering is
3:18
combining or creating a system around
3:20
all these things routines/loop
3:23
so that we can give a larger scope of
3:25
work as input to an AI coding assistant
3:28
and have it work through it
3:29
incrementally right because we never
3:31
want to have a coding agent try to
3:33
handle too much at once or it will get
3:35
completely overwhelmed. And the main
3:36
idea with loop engineering is we want to
3:38
have some main orchestrator agent that
3:40
we talk to. We do minimal prompting,
3:42
just telling it what we want at a high
3:44
level, and it figures out how to set up
3:46
the loop and the entire system. And it's
3:49
really easy to do this in Cloud Code.
3:50
This is really cool. You just tell it to
3:53
use the loop skill. So, there's a
3:55
capability built right into the tool
3:56
where it knows how to set up these loop
3:58
systems based on what we ask it to do.
4:00
So, I passed in some kind of simple spec
4:02
document here, like I just have this as
4:04
an example. These are the tasks that we
4:06
wanted to go through incrementally. And
4:07
so, my prompt is telling it to load the
4:09
skill. So now how to set up the loop and
4:11
then every cycle it's just going to do
4:13
the first unchecked task do the
4:15
validation and then that loop is done
4:17
and then on the next loop it'll go
4:18
through and do the next task and so
4:20
eventually all the tasks will be
4:22
complete and then our primary cloud code
4:24
session here that set up everything is
4:26
going to report back to us right so like
4:29
right here cloud code is sort of the
4:31
orchestrator but then also the workers
4:33
because it sets up the loop itself but
4:35
it is really cool to watch this run so
4:37
I'll send off a request here and I'll
4:39
Wait for it to run a little bit. I'll
4:41
come back and show you kind of how it
4:42
works. But you can see that it loads the
4:44
loop skills the very first thing. So it
4:46
knows how to orchestrate things and
4:48
it'll do the slash loop by itself that I
4:50
just showed how you can do manually.
4:52
Okay. So I came back a couple minutes
4:54
later and it's already done with the
4:55
first two tasks. So it's gone through
4:57
two iterations of the loop already. And
4:59
so if we go up to the top, we can see
5:01
that it says this is sequential task
5:03
list. It's going to do the first task
5:04
and then it's going to schedule a quick
5:06
wakeup. So, it sets up the slash loop by
5:08
itself. And if we scroll down a little
5:10
bit after it does and validates the
5:12
first task, we can see that it's
5:14
resuming with a /loop wake up. And look
5:17
at that. I didn't write this prompt
5:18
myself at all. I know this is a very,
5:20
very basic example, but I want to stay
5:23
simple on purpose, but it wrote the
5:25
prompt /loop work through plan.mmd one
5:28
task at a time. And so the kinds of
5:30
systems that Boris is building is
5:32
obviously going to be a lot more
5:33
elaborate with how we're telling it to
5:35
run the looping and building in routines
5:37
and describing how we want it to prompt
5:39
and work through our context. But at the
5:41
basic sense, this is really all it
5:43
takes. And so now it's just going to
5:45
keep knocking things out one at a time.
5:48
So that is loop engineering in the most
5:50
basic form possible. But now I want to
Downsides and Token Costs
5:54
get into some of the downsides here,
5:56
which some of them are definitely pretty
5:58
obvious to you already. Problem number
6:00
one, there is no way you're going to
6:02
convince me that loop engineering is the
6:03
way to get the best results possible
6:05
with AI coding assistance. I mean, come
6:08
on, this has to be hyperbole here. Boris
6:10
Journey says that there are days he
6:12
manages tens of thousands of AI agents
6:14
at once. Like, really? Is is that
6:17
actually practical? Is that going to
6:18
scale? Like are you really building cla
6:21
code with tens of thousands of agents
6:22
per day? I mean maybe that does explain
6:24
some of the bugs we have in cloud code.
6:26
I feel like there's constantly a couple
6:28
annoying ones, but yeah, overall like
6:30
building these kinds of loops if we make
6:32
it a very tight controlled system,
6:34
that's what I'll talk about in a little
6:35
bit. I think it's good. And for building
6:37
proof of concepts and exploring ideas,
6:39
like I think it's really good, but it's
6:42
not like I want to drive all my AI
6:44
coding with them. And then the second
6:45
big problem is cost. Because with loop
6:48
engineering, we're relying on some kind
6:49
of orchestrator to set up the system and
6:52
really determine how to get to the end
6:54
goal. So, it figures out how many
6:56
workers to spin off, how many loops to
6:58
do, and that gets super expensive. So,
7:00
the dashboard that I built that I'll
7:02
show you at the end of this video, I
7:03
built cost tracking into it. And so, for
7:06
a single run, like here are all the
7:07
loops that the orchestrator went
7:08
through, it costed me over a million
7:10
tokens just to build a relatively simple
7:13
application. And yes, I'm sure there are
7:15
a lot of optimizations that I can do
7:17
here, but I think you can see just by
7:19
looking at this, I mean, this is part of
7:21
why I built the dashboard. You can see
7:23
why it would be so expensive because we
7:25
send in our initial spec to the
7:27
orchestrator and it has to reason about
7:29
that and then figure out how many
7:30
workers to spin off. Then it has to
7:32
prompt them all. They each spend tokens
7:34
and then the results come back. The
7:36
orchestrator has to then reason about
7:38
that again and then send off the next
7:39
wave. No matter how you design the
7:42
system, there's a lot of context passing
7:44
and reasoning to make everything work
7:46
here in a distributed way. So, it's a
7:48
really powerful system and it's cool how
7:51
far you can take this kind of stuff with
7:53
the self- validation, but man, does it
7:56
get so expensive. And then really quick,
7:58
the third problem with loop engineering
8:00
is at least for a lot of setups, you're
8:02
not really working between different
8:04
coding agent sessions. Like when you're
8:05
just using /loop in claw code like Boris
8:08
talks about a lot, it's really just
8:10
continuing in the same coding agent
8:12
session. So if you loop for a while,
8:14
you're going to completely bloat your
8:16
context for your LLM and overwhelm it.
8:19
And so we need a system where we can
8:22
distribute the work actually between
8:24
different coding agent sessions and make
8:26
it so they can all communicate to each
8:28
other and have an idea of like where
8:30
they fit in the larger goal. And so
8:32
that's what I want to cover for the rest
Deterministic Workflows with Archon
8:34
of the video here. So I want to talk
8:35
about how I actually work on a
8:37
day-to-day basis because this will cover
8:40
how we can solve for a lot of these
8:42
problems we have with loop engineering.
8:43
So I use my tool Archon, but I'm not
8:46
just trying to like push Archon on you
8:47
here. I just want to talk about how I
8:49
use it in a way that solves for the
8:52
problems of cost, reliability, and how
8:54
do we actually orchestrate many
8:56
different coding agent sessions. And so
8:59
go through this with me here. So, Archon
9:01
is my harness builder. Allows us to
9:04
build workflows that orchestrate many
9:06
coding agent sessions to handle larger
9:09
tasks. And so, for example, a really
9:11
classic AI coding workflow is you do
9:13
your planning, you do your
9:14
implementation and then you do your code
9:17
review or your testing. And so, we can
9:19
build this as a single Archon workflow.
9:21
There's a ton of content that I have on
9:23
Archon on my channel. I'll link to a
9:25
video right here to help you get started
9:27
if you're interested in this. But again,
9:29
I just want to focus on like how I use
9:30
this on a day-to-day basis to kind of do
9:33
loops. Like you can do loop engineering
9:35
with Archon. You can build the Ralph
9:37
loop with Archon. So I'll show you an
9:40
example of a workflow here. If I go into
9:42
the default workflows, there's a ton
9:43
that we have that ship with Archon.
9:46
Let's take a look at fix GitHub issue
9:48
for example. And so I don't want to get
9:49
too in the weeds here, but I just want
9:51
to show you really quickly at a high
9:52
level how this workflow works. And
9:54
another really important thing with
9:56
Archon is that we're not having the
9:58
agent drive the entire thing. It's more
10:01
deterministic because we set up the
10:03
process in this workflow file and then
10:06
we even have certain steps that are
10:07
deterministic. Like the agent is not
10:09
driving it. We are guaranteeing that
10:11
it's going to happen. So when we're
10:12
building these loops and larger tasks
10:15
that we have our coding agent knock out,
10:17
we want to actually take the decision
10:19
away from the coding agent as much as we
10:21
can only applying the reasoning of the
10:23
LLM when we actually need it to write
10:25
the code. For example, like we might
10:26
want our agent to write the code but not
10:28
actually decide the test to run because
10:30
we know what it looks like for our test
10:32
to pass. And so for this workflow, first
10:35
we extract the issue number. So the
10:37
input here is some GitHub issue that we
10:39
want to fix or address. So we extract
10:41
the context, we fetch the issue context
10:45
and then we classify it. So we have a
10:46
large language model decide at first are
10:49
we addressing a bug or are we
10:51
implementing a new feature and then the
10:53
workflow is going to be dynamic based on
10:56
that decision. So the kind of thing that
10:58
your orchestrator would usually decide
11:00
we're more enforcing a specific process
11:03
here like this is the kind of thing that
11:04
I want to sort of layer on top of loop
11:06
engineering like let me be in the loop
11:08
let me determine how the workflow can
11:11
progress and so then we research the
11:13
issue investigate it and then we go do
11:16
the implementation and the validation
11:17
and we create the pull request right
11:19
step by step each one of the steps we're
11:21
using markdown documents as context so
11:24
we're handing things off between the
11:26
steps But then each step is running in
11:28
its own coding agent session. So if
11:30
we're handling a larger GitHub issue,
11:31
it's not like this entire thing is
11:33
running with / loop and cloud code
11:34
getting totally overwhelmed with each of
11:36
the tasks that we're doing as we're
11:38
planning, implementing, and validating.
11:40
And the way that I can manage cost here
11:42
is every single node in this archon
11:45
workflow, I can actually decide what
11:47
model am I going to use. And so for
11:50
example with the classify step here at
11:52
the top when we're figuring out you know
11:54
what kind of issue do we need to address
11:55
in the rest of the workflow. This is
11:57
kind of like the orchestrator decision
11:59
we can use a small model like maybe
12:01
using haik coup or miniax m3 kim 2.7 for
12:05
example right like what we can do in
12:07
archon is even mix providers. So we can
12:10
use cloud code for the implementation
12:12
and then we can use codecs for the
12:13
review and then for all of our context
12:15
loading and exploration up front. We can
12:18
use a smaller model like Kimmyk 2.7. And
12:21
so that's one of the other big issues I
12:23
see with using /goal or routines or
12:25
loops in cloud code is you're just using
12:27
one model for pretty much everything.
12:29
That's part of the problem of why it's
12:31
so expensive because when we're doing
12:33
larger amounts of work like this, of
12:35
course, you're going to have to spend
12:36
more tokens. But you don't always need
12:39
to spend the most per token for every
12:42
step of your workflow. And I know I'm
12:44
really really driving this in the ground
12:45
right now, but yet another reason you
12:47
want some kind of harness like what you
12:48
can build with Archon is we have
12:50
durability. So this is my Neon database.
12:52
I'm storing all of my logs and runs in
12:56
Postgress so that I can resume a
12:59
workflow even if my machine goes down or
13:01
I cancel things like whatever I do I'm
13:03
always able to resume on exactly the
13:05
step that I was in that larger loop or
13:07
that larger workflow. So I have all my
13:09
conversations the code bases that I'm
13:12
operating on with Archon. Everything is
13:14
durable and it's super easy to resume
13:16
any work that I'm doing. Okay, cool. So
Orchestrating Parallel Coding Agents
13:18
now I want to show you how I actually
13:20
use Archon on a day-to-day basis. a lot
13:22
of ties that we can draw to loop
13:24
engineering and things that I've really
13:26
fixed with it, right? And so in a very
13:28
very basic sense, one of the most
13:30
classic workflows that I use with archon
13:32
is fixing GitHub issues. Most of the
13:35
input for my day-to-day work is issues
13:37
in a repo. Either I'll create them or
13:39
someone else will. And so we can use
13:41
archon to send off workflows to run in
13:44
parallel handling multiple GitHub issues
13:46
at the exact same time. And this is very
13:49
much like loop engineering because we
13:51
have our primary cloud code here as our
13:54
orchestrator and it's figuring out based
13:56
on my higher level request. I'm going to
13:58
create the prompts and dispatch the
14:00
workflows. Work trees are also a really
14:02
important part of loop engineering.
14:04
Boris talks about this as well. If we're
14:06
having many different agents handling
14:08
tasks in a loop, we need to make sure
14:09
they're running in isolation so they're
14:11
not stepping on each other's toes. That
14:13
is how we scale our output with AI
14:15
coding assistance. And so we have our
14:17
cloud code here kicking off four
14:19
workflows to handle GitHub issues. It's
14:22
going to validate the PRs after like
14:25
make sure that they are actually created
14:26
and this is where we can come in with
14:27
human in the loop as well. And then
14:29
it'll run four more workflows to
14:31
validate like perform a code review on
14:33
each of the issues as well. So very
14:35
comprehensive kind of a loop in a sense
14:37
where it's like handle the issues
14:38
validate and then do a code review. And
14:41
uh another thing as far as like making
14:43
this more reliable is with archon
14:45
workflows, we can also build human in
14:47
the loop within any individual node in
14:49
the workflow. So we can always have it
14:50
pause for us to validate something
14:52
before it continues. Which is one of the
14:54
biggest problems with loop engineering
14:56
right now in general is that a lot of
14:57
times people set up these systems to
14:59
just go go and then you have it run for
15:01
a day and by the time it comes back you
15:03
just have crap. Like I've had that
15:05
myself as I've tested a lot of things
15:07
within cloud code like routines and
15:08
sloop. And so I'll send this off here
15:11
and I'll just pause and come back once
15:13
it's done. So we can walk through
15:15
everything that it accomplished here.
15:17
And the best part about all of this is
15:19
we actually have nine coding agent
15:22
sessions for this entire loop or
15:24
whatever you want to call this entire
15:26
harness, right? Like one per GitHub
15:27
issue fix, one per review, and then we
15:29
have our primary orchestrator. So, we're
15:31
doing a ton of work, but at the same
15:33
time, we actually are pretty lean for
15:36
each individual session because
15:38
actually, I kind of have to correct
15:39
myself. It's more than just nine
15:40
sessions because even within each
15:42
individual Archon workflow, we're
15:44
running separate coding agent sessions
15:45
where we can have different models. We
15:47
can optimize for cost. There is a lot of
15:49
engineering that goes on behind the
15:51
scenes here. All right, so I'm back
15:53
after the entire thing ran. I just want
15:55
to show you how comprehensive we can be
15:57
here. And so we have the four workflow
16:00
runs for actually fixing the issues. And
16:02
then cloud code here is really
16:03
monitoring and orchestrating everything,
16:05
right? So like as the different tasks
16:06
are done, it's coming in and checking on
16:08
them. And then finally, we have
16:10
everything done together. So all four
16:12
fixed workflows are done. Then it
16:14
launches the code reviews cuz it
16:16
confirmed that all of the pull requests
16:18
are ready to be reviewed. And you can
16:20
even ask for a status update. So like
16:22
while the Archon workflows are running,
16:23
if we want to see where we're at, we can
16:25
of course check the logs in the Archon
16:26
web UI. I have that as well. But then
16:28
also we can just ask our orchestrator,
16:30
right? So it really is in control of our
16:33
entire situation here. And then finally,
16:36
all the reviews are done and it gives us
16:39
the things that need our attention now.
16:40
So we can really come in and direct
16:42
things from here. So it's the harness
16:44
driving everything, but we still can be
16:45
in the loop wherever we want. And I know
16:48
there's a lot that goes into effectively
16:50
orchestrating parallel coding agents. So
16:53
there's a lot of content on my channel
16:54
where I cover this kind of thing. Like
16:56
for example, one thing that you have to
16:57
do a lot is branches in your database,
17:00
right? Like if each coding agent is
17:01
working on something in parallel, you
17:03
don't want them to be stepping on each
17:05
other's toes, not just with code
17:06
changes, but also database changes. So
17:08
work trees and neon is a super powerful
17:10
thing. A lot of different things like
17:12
port conflicts that we want to solve for
17:14
as well. So I'll link to a video right
17:15
here where I cover that stuff and just
17:18
generally how we can make parallel AI
17:19
coding more reliable. So assuming you
17:21
take care of all of that, you can really
17:22
let Archon rip on as many GitHub issues
17:25
or whatever in parallel. Very cool how
17:28
far we can take our output here. All
My Pi Loop Engineering Dashboard
17:30
right, so we have covered a lot in this
17:32
video already. Loop engineering basics,
17:34
the downsides of it, how I'm using
17:35
Archon to extract the good parts out
17:37
into more deterministic workflows. But
17:40
last, I want to cover a system that I
17:42
built for loop engineering in its purest
17:44
form. Because I presented these issues
17:46
to you, but I I do see a lot of promise
17:49
with this. I want to try to build a
17:51
system that solves for these problems.
17:53
And so I've built this dashboard that
17:55
I'm really excited to show you right
17:57
now. I actually have it open sourced on
17:59
GitHub. Link to this in the description.
18:01
And I have built this to solve for a lot
18:03
of the problems that we have with loop
18:06
engineering right now. So first of all,
18:07
we have durability. Uh just like with
18:10
Archon, all of the loops that we run and
18:12
the different events and logs, I'm
18:13
storing this here so we can always
18:15
resume a workflow later on. So we're
18:18
managing all of our state in an external
18:21
database. So we're not relying on that
18:23
staying in any coding agent session. And
18:26
so our main orchestrator, it is going to
18:28
read through this state here and then
18:30
figure out like okay, what is the next
18:32
thing that we need to do? And so then
18:34
it's going to call upon the workers to
18:36
accomplish all of that like build a new
18:38
feature or do some kind of validation
18:39
whatever it needs to do. And then those
18:41
workers are going to go back and they're
18:42
going to update the state that we have
18:44
in our database. Like again I'm using
18:45
Neon for Postgress here. And so this is
18:48
our loop, right? Because then the next
18:49
time the orchestrator runs, it's going
18:51
to get that updated state from the
18:52
workers and then figure out the next
18:54
workers to invoke. And there are a
18:56
couple of problems that I'm solving by
18:58
building something like this. And and I
19:00
want to start by saying like this is
19:02
more experimental. I'm just showing you
19:03
something that I'm working on and kind
19:04
of building into my own second brain.
19:06
But first of all, I'm driving everything
19:08
with Pi. So I'm actually using my Kimmy
19:11
subscription with Kimmy K 2.6, 6 now
19:13
Kimmy K 2.7 to drive all of these
19:16
workflows. So yes, it is a lot of
19:18
tokens, but I'm not using Opus for
19:20
everything, but I'm still getting really
19:22
good results because of the harness that
19:24
I built here that elevates the model.
19:27
And then I have a lot of observability
19:29
built into this dashboard. I mean,
19:31
obviously it being a dashboard, it
19:32
solves part of that reliability problem,
19:34
which obviously I'm still working on.
19:36
But just being able to see exactly the
19:38
decisions that are going on here means
19:39
that it's easier for me to uh look at
19:42
this, even have my coding agent analyze
19:44
the runs in the database, and then
19:46
figure out how to improve the loop, how
19:48
to improve the harness here. And so I
19:51
just have been going through a lot of
19:53
really simple examples, but like
19:54
non-trivial enough where it does have to
19:56
go through quite a few rounds to build
19:57
it. So like building a single page
19:59
combine board as a static web app. I
20:01
just take this prompt and I'll show you
20:03
it running live right now. Like I'll
20:04
just send this in and I will start a
20:06
loop. And it's really cool. We can see
20:08
that the orchestrator is deciding how to
20:10
split up the work right now. And then we
20:12
also have like the full run history
20:14
here. It's pretty neat. Like it's super
20:16
easy to get this up and running. Uh if
20:17
you just want to check out the GitHub
20:18
repo linked in the description. But
20:20
after a little bit the orchestrator will
20:22
decide here is how I'm going to create
20:24
that first wave and then we'll see the
20:26
workers dispatched. So there we go. The
20:28
orchestrator spent 6,000 tokens with
20:30
that initial planning and then prompting
20:32
our first three workers in round number
20:35
one. And so we don't have to watch paint
20:37
dry seeing this go to completion here.
20:39
But you get the idea. We saw the full
20:41
run in the logs earlier of how it'll go
20:43
round by round doing validation each
20:45
time. And we can even have human in the
20:47
loop so that we get to actually take a
20:49
look at what has happened in the first
20:50
round before the orchestrator moves on
20:53
to the next. That is the kind of
20:55
reliability that I feel like we really
20:57
need to have right now in order to build
20:59
anything more than simple demos with uh
21:01
this kind of loop engineering setup. And
21:03
so yeah, I I would encourage you to just
21:05
play around with this kind of idea. Like
21:07
building a a dashboard to manage more
21:09
autonomous tasks in something like your
Deploying Control Systems to Production
21:11
second brain is a big thing that I'm
21:13
focusing on right now. And we can even
21:14
take this kind of dashboard and deploy
21:16
it to the cloud as well. So we can
21:18
access it from anywhere. maybe even
21:20
start to share our loop setup with our
21:23
teammates. And these days, it's just so
21:25
easy to take applications that you build
21:27
locally for these kinds of control
21:28
systems and deploy them to production so
21:30
you can use it remotely or have a team
21:32
use it. Retool is a tool specifically
21:35
I've been leaning on a lot for these
21:36
kinds of deployments. And so it's just
21:38
so easy to create an app here and then
21:41
we can import React code. So I just had
21:43
Cloud Code build the entire dashboard in
21:46
React with the idea of I'm going to
21:48
deploy this here. It's so incredibly
21:49
easy. So, I just go in and I take the
21:52
zip file of the front end that I just
21:53
showed you and then its agent is going
21:55
to go through wiring everything up. So,
21:57
it'll connect to the backend with the
21:58
API that I have running with PI. It'll
22:01
get everything deployed to a real URL
22:02
that I can use. It's really neat. So,
22:04
for example, here connecting to my Neon
22:06
database where I'm storing all of the
22:08
runs for durability. It asks me to set
22:11
up a connection here. So, I can create a
22:12
new resource. I can select Postgress
22:15
because that's what Neon is running
22:16
under the hood and then set up all of my
22:18
connection information here. So really
22:20
easy to make that connections. I'm just
22:22
deploying the front end here and then
22:23
connecting it to wherever I'm hosting my
22:26
app hosting PI running behind the
22:28
scenes. So I'll get all this hooked up
22:29
off camera and then I'll show you the
22:31
final result here. And there we go.
22:33
Everything is deployed. We can see our
22:35
app hosted in the cloud just like it was
22:37
running locally. Very cool. So now we
22:40
have a URL where we can share this.
22:41
There's also a lot of other cool things
22:43
you can do in retool like you can set up
22:44
permission groups and so certain actions
22:46
that you can gate with an API endpoint.
22:48
So you have to approve it and have the
22:50
right permissions to do so. So for
22:52
example being able to pause the workflow
22:55
and then resume it. If I click this
22:56
right here you can see that approve and
22:58
resume and you can see the identity that
23:00
I have through retool. It's giving me
23:01
permission to actually do that. And then
23:03
it's also very easy to edit this
23:05
application. I can continue to make
23:07
changes with it here in the cloud as I
23:09
need adding new features to the front
23:11
end, whatever I need as I'm evolving my
23:13
dashboard. So yeah, I've just been doing
23:14
a lot of this with like deploying
23:16
dashboards for observability and helping
23:17
me with all my systems for my second
23:19
brain and my AI coding. Very powerful
23:21
stuff. And a quick shout out to the
23:23
retool team. Ever since I've been using
23:24
their platform, I've been working with
23:26
them and I even collab to bring this
23:28
integration in the video today. It's a
23:30
great platform because you get to build
23:32
your applications directly in retool or
23:34
you can import it like I showed earlier.
23:36
But then your team regardless has a
23:38
single governed path to production with
23:41
audit trails. Really easy to make your
23:43
changes just with chat like I showed
23:44
here and the review system with human in
23:46
the loop. All of it that you need to
23:48
ship your apps to production. And I'll
23:50
have a link in the description. If you
23:52
go now, you get free app imports through
23:54
July 1st and bonus AI credits on all
23:56
paid plans. So that's everything I have
Outro
23:58
to cover for Loop Engineering. the
24:00
basics, the problems with it, how I'm
24:02
solving for it because I I really do
24:03
want to incorporate loop engineering.
24:05
Like I like the concept of it and I want
24:07
to drive how autonomous my coding agents
24:10
can be, but you got to have the right
24:12
system otherwise things are going to
24:13
completely fall apart like we've already
24:15
talked about. And so I hope I've
24:17
inspired some ideas for you even like
24:18
how to use Archon or start to build this
24:21
sort of harness for yourself. Really, I
24:23
would just fold loop engineering into
24:25
harness engineering. It doesn't quite
24:26
deserve its own buzzword, right? But
24:28
like there are some good ideas here. And
24:30
so I hope you found this useful. If you
24:32
did, I would really appreciate a like
24:34
and a subscribe.

Core takeaway

This is a useful correction source: loop engineering is real, but mostly as a pattern inside harness engineering, not as magic.

Cole frames the new fad as “designing loops that prompt your agents,” where the human gives a high-level goal and the system repeatedly wakes up, checks state, dispatches work, validates, and continues. But he is also skeptical: loops are unreliable, token-hungry, and not always practical without durability, observability, cost control, and human gates.

OMNI translation:

OMNI should not build “autonomous loops” as open-ended agents running forever. It should build governed workflow loops: durable state, bounded tasks, explicit validation, model routing, human approvals, and traceable control surfaces.

Key concepts to preserve
1. Loop engineering = agents prompting agents, not humans prompting every step

The cited Claude Code framing is: “I don’t prompt Claude anymore. I write loops and the loops do the work.” Cole breaks that down into simple primitives: /loop for repeated wakeups, /goal for working until done criteria are met, and /routines for scheduled jobs.

OMNI keeper:

Looping is just scheduled/repeated agent execution around state and criteria.

Doctrine candidate:

A loop is only safe if the wake condition, state source, done condition, and stop condition are explicit.

2. Loops are useful for incremental work, not giant one-shot tasks

Cole’s practical point: the value of loop engineering is letting an agent work through a larger scope incrementally because coding agents get overwhelmed if asked to handle too much at once.

OMNI translation:

This is directly relevant to Build-OS and D7:

process one source batch at a time
handle one unchecked task at a time
validate before next step
resume from current state
avoid bloated context

Doctrine candidate:

Large agent work should be decomposed into validated increments, not oversized prompts.

3. The naive loop failure modes are cost, context bloat, and unreliability

Cole gives three major objections: loops may not produce best-quality results, they can burn huge token volume, and simple /loop setups often stay inside the same coding-agent session until context bloats and overwhelms the model.

OMNI keeper:

Naive autonomous loops fail because they lack:

cost budgets
fresh session boundaries
context compaction strategy
external durable state
eval/validation
human checkpoints
observability

Doctrine candidate:

Unbounded loops turn autonomy into token burn and context decay.

4. Deterministic workflow beats agent deciding everything

Cole’s Archon example is important because it explicitly takes decisions away from the agent when the process is known. The workflow file defines the process; deterministic steps are guaranteed; LLM reasoning is used only where needed, like classification or code writing.

OMNI translation:

This is spine-level Build-OS doctrine.

For OMNI:

deterministic domain contracts where possible
LLM only where judgment/generation/extraction is needed
workflow graph owns sequencing
tools/tests own verification
humans own approvals

Doctrine candidate:

Use LLM reasoning as a component inside a workflow, not as the workflow owner by default.

5. Handoff via artifacts, not one swollen session

Archon passes markdown documents between workflow steps, and each step can run in its own coding-agent session. This avoids the whole planning/implementation/validation path living in one increasingly bloated loop session.

OMNI keeper:

This matches prior Context Hub / OpenWiki / D7 thinking.

Potential OMNI primitive:

artifact_handoff_between_agent_steps

The output of one step becomes a structured artifact consumed by the next, rather than hidden chat context.

Doctrine candidate:

Agent handoffs should move through durable artifacts, not invisible conversational residue.

6. Model routing by workflow node

Cole highlights that each workflow node can choose its own model: cheap/small model for classification or context loading, Claude for implementation, Codex for review, etc. The point is that not every workflow step needs the most expensive model.

OMNI keeper:

Directly supports OMNI model-runtime bundle doctrine.

For OMNI:

cheap model for simple classification
strong model for high-risk synthesis
deterministic script for validation
frontier model for architecture/clinical nuance
local/open model for low-risk private preprocessing

Doctrine candidate:

Model spend should match task difficulty, risk, and required judgment.

7. Durability is non-negotiable for loops

Cole stores logs, runs, conversations, and workflow state in Postgres/Neon so workflows can resume if the machine goes down or the run is canceled. The core idea is external durable state, not relying on the agent session as memory.

OMNI keeper:

This is critical.

For OMNI:

no long-running workflow should depend only on chat/session memory
state belongs in workflow/domain tables
agent session can be disposable
resume must be possible
retries must know completed steps

Doctrine candidate:

Long-running agent loops require external durable state, not session memory.

8. Parallel coding agents need isolation

Cole describes fixing multiple GitHub issues in parallel using separate workflows, worktrees, PR validation, review passes, and isolation so agents do not step on each other. He also names database branches and port conflicts as part of making parallel AI coding reliable.

OMNI translation:

For Build-OS:

separate worktrees
separate DB branches
separate test ports
separate agent sessions
independent PRs
orchestration status
merge/review gates

Doctrine candidate:

Parallel agent work requires environment isolation, not just parallel prompts.

9. HITL checkpoints prevent “run all day, return crap”

Cole says one major problem with loop engineering is letting it “go go” for a day, only to return poor results. His solution is human-in-the-loop pauses inside workflow nodes and round-by-round review before the orchestrator continues.

Later, his dashboard can pause after a round so the human can inspect what happened before the next round.

OMNI keeper:

For OMNI, HITL should be risk-tiered:

low-risk cleanup: auto-continue
moderate-risk code changes: review checkpoint
production deploy: explicit approval
clinical memory: provider/domain adoption
PHI export/bulk outreach: hard gate

Doctrine candidate:

Autonomy should advance through checkpoints, not bypass them.

10. Observability dashboards make loops improvable

Cole’s loop dashboard stores runs/events/logs in a database, shows orchestrator decisions, worker dispatches, token costs, run history, and lets the system or another agent analyze runs to improve the harness.

OMNI keeper:

This is Build-OS + Polaris.

If you cannot see the loop, you cannot improve it.

Doctrine candidate:

Agent loops need control dashboards that expose state, decisions, cost, workers, and validation results.

11. Orchestrator-worker state loop

In the dashboard model, the orchestrator reads external state, decides next workers, workers update database state, and the next orchestrator cycle reads that updated state.

OMNI translation:

This is the clean generic pattern:

external_state → orchestrator_decision → worker_tasks → state_update → validation → next_cycle

Doctrine candidate:

The database/workflow state should be the shared truth between orchestrator and workers.

12. Control systems can become shared production surfaces

Cole then deploys the dashboard as a cloud-accessible control system with permissions, approval/resume actions, identity, and audit trails.

OMNI keeper:

This is a major surface-design insight.

Build-OS should not live only in a terminal.
It should expose control panels for humans.

For OMNI:

workflow run dashboard
pause/resume
approve/reject
inspect agent work
cost/token view
trace view
ownership/identity
audit log

Doctrine candidate:

Autonomous agent systems need human control surfaces, not only backend loops.

OMNI translation

This source is best captured as:

loop engineering → useful pattern

but only when folded into:

harness engineering + durable workflow state + deterministic steps + model routing + artifact handoffs + isolated sessions + HITL checkpoints + observability dashboard

The strongest OMNI rule:

Do not let the agent own the loop if the workflow can own the loop.

The agent should do the parts requiring reasoning, writing, synthesis, or classification. The workflow should own sequencing, persistence, validation, stop conditions, approvals, and state.

Hard read

This is a strong tactical Build-OS source.

The keeper:

Loop engineering is useful only when domesticated into harness engineering: durable state, deterministic workflow steps, bounded agent sessions, model routing, validation, observability, and human checkpoints.

Shortest OMNI version:

OMNI should build workflow-owned loops, not agent-owned loops. Agents can plan, code, classify, and validate inside bounded nodes, but the workflow substrate should own state, sequencing, cost budgets, stop conditions, approvals, and traceable control surfaces.

- reviewer: `Opus` (formal-extraction subagent) · type: `AI assistant` · at: `2026-07-07` · purpose: `formalize Review 001 → structured per-source extraction → feed EVRUN concept registry` · binds nothing (`GRD-036`/`GRD-044`)

> The agent reads §1 verbatim + §3 Review 001 (Knox) IN FULL, then writes the formal per-source extraction HERE (not a sidecar). Formalize Review 001's strategic read — verify/sharpen it, do not re-derive.

Cross-source convergence is folded into the EVRUN **concept registry**, not duplicated here.

⬇️⬇️⬇️  AGENT WRITES THE FORMAL EXTRACTION BELOW  ⬇️⬇️⬇️

**HEADLINE VERDICT.** `full_semantic` tier by Knox depth (12-point strategic read), but **near-zero OMNI net-new** — this is a **high-convergence AFFIRM source, not a frame-extension.** Cole Medin (practitioner/tool-author) reacts to Boris Cherny + Peter Steinberger's "loop engineering" ("I don't prompt Claude anymore, I write loops and the loops do the work" [1:48]) and lands *exactly* on OMNI's existing spine: **the workflow — not the agent — should own the loop.** Durable external state, deterministic sequencing, bounded increments, model routing per node, artifact handoffs, session/environment isolation, risk-tiered HITL, and an observability/control surface are the domestication conditions. Every one of these already lives in the wave-3 registry (201/202/208/210/214/215/216/220/224/228) and in OMNI doctrine (candidate≠commit · workflow-lane-is-the-unit · containment≠authority · no-silent-promotion · CNS coordination · Polaris proof). **Nick's gut note is correct: it's basic relative to what OMNI already holds.** The single genuinely useful *sharpening* is the **human control surface for autonomous agent work** (pause/resume/approve/reject/cost/trace/identity/audit as a first-class shared surface, not a terminal) — and even that = `exception_surface` (210) + `generated_ui_as_agent_coordination_surface` (201) + Polaris. Strongest line: **"Do not let the agent own the loop if the workflow can own the loop"** [~15:31→outro 24:23] = OMNI verbatim. Keeper hygiene (`GRD-039`): keep the *pattern*, drop the *stack* (Archon/Retool/Pi/Kimi/Neon are examples, never OMNI infra).

**Build reality (grep-verified from `/Users/bloomfrontdesk1/Desktop/main-app`, `rg -i` on `app lib components scripts supabase middleware.ts`):** the v2/v3 **care app** carries the *domain* analogs — a durable async job queue with retries + idempotency (`lib/jobs/enqueueOutboundJob.ts`, `supabase/migrations/*outbound_jobs*`, `*reconciliation*`), audited capability gates + audit actions (`lib/auth/capabilities.ts`, `lib/events/audit-actions.ts`, `staff_audit_rls`), confidence-gated AI chart review + `review_required` intake (`lib/ai/chartReviewEngine.ts`, `chart_ai_reviews`, `lib/intake/targets.ts`), and domain orchestrators/dispatchers (`lib/intake/runtime/*orchestrator*`, `lib/rules/runtime/dispatcher.ts`). **What is genuinely ABSENT-as-named:** agent loop/goal/routines primitives, orchestrator-worker *agent* loops, per-node model routing, token/cost tracking, an agent observability/control dashboard, and worktree/DB-branch/port isolation for parallel *coding agents*. → dominant pattern = **`doctrine=AFFIRM · build=partial/absent`** (same as the rest of the wave: doctrine holds, agent-harness layer uncoded).

#### B. Net-new primitives — dedup vs registry §2 (201–230 mints) + standard OMNI primitives. *"dedup-pending, Opus-main verifies."*

Knox proposed 5 candidates. Verdict: **0 genuine net-new mechanisms; all are NAMES over existing primitives.**
- `workflow_owned_loop` — loop where the workflow engine owns sequencing/persistence/validation/stop/approvals; agents do bounded nodes — **EXISTS-AS: `workflow_lane_as_architecture_unit` + Build-OS "workflow owns the loop, agent≠owner-of-truth" (201/202/208/210/220) + candidate≠commit. NAME only; do NOT re-mint.** *(dedup-pending, Opus-main verifies.)*
- `external_loop_state` — durable state store shared by orchestrator+workers vs one long session — **EXISTS-AS: `state_externalized_context` (220) + `context_packet` + Knowledge-Reservoirs + 216 durability; build-echo = `lib/jobs` durable queue. NAME/sharpen.** *(dedup-pending.)*
- `artifact_handoff_between_agent_steps` — structured artifact transfer between nodes — **EXISTS-AS: `context_packet` + `spec_as_agent_contract` (208, input) + `typed_subagent_result_contract` (224, output) + 213/219 context-delivery. NAME.** *(dedup-pending.)*
- `loop_control_dashboard` — human control surface: orchestrator decisions/worker status/run-history/cost/validation + pause/resume — **EXISTS-AS: `exception_surface` (210) + `generated_ui_as_agent_coordination_surface` (201) + Polaris/proof + Surface-Map P5. Strongest of the five as a Surface-Map candidate NAME, but NOT a new mechanism.** *(dedup-pending, Opus-main verifies.)*
- `checkpointed_autonomy` — advance through bounded stages with human/deterministic gates at risk points — **EXISTS-AS: `control_transition_protocol` (210) + Agent-Work-Protocol §8 checkpoint + `autonomy_level` + targeted-HITL (T4). NAME.** *(dedup-pending.)*
- (also considered) parallel worktree/DB-branch/port isolation → **EXISTS-AS: containment/isolation family (`assume_breach_agent_posture` 205 · `write_access_eval_environment`/`shadow_agent_production` 216 · session-isolation 220). NAME.** · per-node model routing → **`virtual_model_endpoint`/`model_admissibility_gate` (206) + `model_placement_policy` (201).** · cost visibility → **`outcome_per_token_metric` (206).**

**Net-new tally for 235: 0 genuine mechanisms** (matches the zero-mechanism/affirm class: 210/212/213/226). Contribution = affirm-weight + one Surface-Map *name-sharpen* (`loop_control_dashboard`).

#### C. Reread flags
- **None blocking.** Metadata + Knox read both present and rich → `identity_confidence: high_from_operator_metadata`; no derive-from-transcript needed.
- **Sponsor/commercial-interest flag** (already in §0.1): Retool segment + Archon self-promotion + Pi/Kimi subscription framing → tooling claims are vendor-adjacent; the *pattern* is the keeper, the *stack* is not OMNI infra (`GRD-039`). Do not import Archon/Retool/Pi/Neon/Claude-Code as required infrastructure.
- **Low-yield flag** for Opus-main: heavy overlap with 202/208/210/216/220/224/228 → fold as convergence/affirm, do NOT re-mint. If registry space is tight, 235 can be logged as a one-line affirm row.

#### D. One-line hard read + strongest OMNI line
- **Hard read:** Loop engineering is real but overhyped — it only becomes safe when *domesticated into harness engineering* (durable external state · deterministic workflow steps · bounded validated increments · per-node model routing · artifact handoffs · environment isolation · risk-tiered HITL · observability/control surface); OMNI already holds every leg, so 235 affirms the spine and adds no new frame.
- **Strongest OMNI line:** *"Do not let the agent own the loop if the workflow can own the loop"* — agents plan/code/classify/validate inside bounded nodes; the **workflow substrate owns state, sequencing, cost budgets, stop conditions, approvals, and traceable control surfaces** (= OMNI candidate≠commit + workflow-lane-is-the-unit + CNS coordination + Polaris proof, verbatim).
